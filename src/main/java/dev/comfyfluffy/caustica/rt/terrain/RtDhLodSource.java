/**
 * Reads Distant Horizons' persistent terrain database and turns it into axis-aligned boxes that can be
 * meshed and put in the ray-tracing acceleration structure.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 * Caustica builds every section from {@code level.getChunk(...)}, the client chunk cache. Beyond the
 * server's view distance there is no block data in the process at all — so a Caustica-native LOD can
 * reduce detail on loaded terrain, but it can never show terrain that was never sent. DH already solves
 * that problem: it maintains a durable, generated, streamed world database far past the chunk cache.
 *
 * <h2>What this deliberately does NOT do</h2>
 * It does not touch DH's renderer, intercept its draw calls, or read its GPU buffers. DH's rendering
 * should be switched OFF when this is used. DH is a data source here and Caustica does all drawing, as
 * rays. That avoids the whole class of problems that come from two world renderers coexisting, and it
 * means this survives DH changing its rendering backend — which it has done twice recently.
 *
 * <h2>Why reflection</h2>
 * DH is optional. A hard compile-time dependency would make Caustica refuse to load without it, and
 * would pin a DH version. Everything here resolves lazily and degrades to "no LOD" if DH is absent, is
 * a version whose API moved, or has not finished loading a world. The API surface used is small and
 * documented — {@code DhApi.Delayed.terrainRepo}, {@code DhApi.Delayed.worldProxy}, and
 * {@code IDhApiTerrainDataRepo.getAllTerrainDataAtDetailLevelAndPos} — and it is a versioned public
 * API rather than internals, so it is a reasonable thing to bind to loosely.
 *
 * <h2>Data shape</h2>
 * DH returns {@code DhApiTerrainDataPoint[][][]} indexed [x][z][column entry]. Each entry is already a
 * vertical RUN — a {@code bottomYBlockPos}..{@code topYBlockPos} span of one block state, with baked
 * block and sky light. That is run-length encoding done for us: a 200-block stone column is one entry,
 * not 200. Emitting one box per entry is therefore already a large win before any greedy merging, and
 * it is why this does not need a general voxel mesher.
 *
 * <p>Crucially the entry carries a {@code blockStateWrapper} whose {@code getWrappedMcObject()} is a real
 * Minecraft {@link BlockState}. That means distant terrain can resolve to the SAME material table entries
 * as near terrain — roughness, metalness, emission, LabPBR maps — rather than the baked vertex colour a
 * renderer-interception approach would give you. Distant lava glowing correctly is downstream of this
 * one method call.
